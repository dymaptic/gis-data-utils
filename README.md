## [database-management](database-management/README.md)

Set of scripts to help with managing a geodatabase. These scripts are especially useful during the initial phases of development when the database schema can change. Tasks you can accomplish with these scripts:
- create a feature class from a csv file that contains attribute information
- create a standalone table from a csv file that contains attribute information
- add fields to an existing feature class
- batch create multiple feature classes from a folder of csv files containing attribute information
- batch create multiple standalone tables from a folder of csv files containing attribute information
- batch create relationship classes based on a csv file that contains information about the tables that take part in the relationship, relationship type, keys, etc.
